# Tree Structures

This folder contains various tree data structure implementations and algorithms in C++.

## Contents

- `binary_tree_traversal.cpp`: Demonstrates inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals
- `binary_search_tree.cpp`: Insert and search operations in a binary search tree
- `lowest_common_ancestor.cpp`: Finds the lowest common ancestor (LCA) in a BST

## Why Trees?

Trees are foundational structures for organizing hierarchical data.  
They're used in compilers, filesystems, databases, and AI search trees.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

- AVL Tree implementation (self-balancing)
- Tree visualization with Graphviz or ASCII art
- Directory structure parser (real-world project idea)
