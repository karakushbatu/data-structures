# Tree Structures

This folder contains various tree data structure implementations and algorithms in C++.

## Contents

- `binary_tree_traversal.cpp`: Demonstrates inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals
- `binary_search_tree.cpp`: Insert and search operations in a binary search tree
- `lowest_common_ancestor.cpp`: Finds the lowest common ancestor (LCA) in a BST

## Why Trees?

Trees are foundational structures for organizing hierarchical data.  
They're used in compilers, filesystems, databases, and AI search trees.

## Projects
### Directory Tree Generator

A minimal tool that prints the directory structure of a given path in a tree-like format, similar to the Unix `tree` command.

### How It Works

- Uses C++17's `std::filesystem` to recursively walk through folders
- Indents and formats output to represent depth
- Easy to extend or integrate into larger tools

### Why this project?

It’s a simple way to apply tree traversal logic to a real-world task.  
Also: it’s a great utility to have when you want to show off your folder structure in README files or demos.

## What’s Next?

- AVL Tree implementation (self-balancing)
- Tree visualization with Graphviz or ASCII art
- Directory structure parser (real-world project idea)
