## 📂 Folder Descriptions

- **linked-list**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **trees**: Binary trees and self-balancing BST implementation with traversal strategies.
- **heaps**: Min-heap, heap sort, and a Python-based heap sort visualizer using ASCII art.
- **graphs**: Graph traversal algorithms, including BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's shortest path.
- **practice-problems**: Algorithmic challenges implemented with different data structures.
- **projects**:
  - `cache-simulator`: A CPU-style LRU/FIFO cache simulator to understand memory access patterns.
  - `memory-pool-allocator`: A basic custom memory allocator using a free-list based on linked lists.
  - `text-editor-buffer`: Implements a simple gap buffer structure for text editing (like in Emacs/Vim).

## Why this repo?

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient software. This repo helps me (and maybe others) revisit core concepts through practical code.
