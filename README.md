# Data Structures

This repository contains my implementations, projects, and experiments related to fundamental data structures. It combines academic coursework, personal curiosity, and practical applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Descriptions

- **linked-list**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **trees**: Binary trees and self-balancing BST implementation with traversal strategies.
- **heaps**: Min-heap, heap sort, and a Python-based heap sort visualizer using ASCII art.
- **graphs**: Graph traversal algorithms, including BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's shortest path.
- **exercises**: Algorithmic challenges implemented with different data structures.
- **projects**:
  - `cache-simulator`: A CPU-style LRU/FIFO cache simulator to understand memory access patterns.
  - `memory-pool-allocator`: A basic custom memory allocator using a free-list based on linked lists.
  - `text-editor-buffer`: Implements a simple gap buffer structure for text editing (like in Emacs/Vim).

## Why this repo?

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient software. This repo helps me (and maybe others) revisit core concepts through practical code.

Feel free to fork, suggest improvements, or just browse around.
