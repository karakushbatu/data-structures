# Linked List Implementations

This folder contains implementations and variations of linked lists in C++.

## Files

- `singly_linked_list.cpp`: Basic singly linked list with insertion at the end and display.
- `doubly_linked_list.cpp`: Doubly linked list with front insertion and bidirectional traversal.


## Highlights

- Dynamic memory management with proper destructors
- Separation of data and behavior through classes
- Focus on clean, readable, and extensible code

## Future Additions

- Circular linked list
- Linked list with tail pointer
- Project: Text buffer using linked list (for a lightweight text editor)
