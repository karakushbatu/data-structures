# Linked List Implementations

This folder contains implementations and variations of linked lists in C++.

## Files

- `singly_linked_list.cpp`: Basic singly linked list with insertion at the end and display.
- `doubly_linked_list.cpp`: Doubly linked list with front insertion and bidirectional traversal.


## Highlights

- Dynamic memory management with proper destructors
- Separation of data and behavior through classes
- Focus on clean, readable, and extensible code

## Future Additions

- Circular linked list
- Linked list with tail pointer

## Projects

###Text Editor Buffer (Mini Project)

A simple line-based text editor simulation using a singly linked list.

Each line of text is stored as a node. You can add, insert, delete, and display lines in the buffer.

### Features

- Add line at end
- Insert line at specific index
- Delete line at index
- Display full buffer

### Why this matters

This project simulates a basic version of how text editors might manage lines internally.  
It demonstrates the use of linked lists in a practical, real-world-inspired scenario.
